Im udantha 👋

Engineer. Builder. Professional tinkerer of both code and circuits.  


some god level pattern recognition  

I’m currently sharpening my teeth on C and C++, while cooking up advanced Python projects that actually do more than just sit there and look pretty.  

What I’m Building & Exploring.... 

Marketplaces & fintech for Sri Lanka  — designing scalable systems with real local impact.  
Startups & tech innovation — I don’t just study business models, I stress-test them. 


Beyond Computer Science 
Because staying in one lane is boring 😏
Mechanical engineering — figuring out how things move, break, and can be rebuilt smarter.  
Electrical engineering — learning circuits and control systems as a stepping stone toward robotics.  
I’m new to these areas, but I learn fast and enjoy breaking boundaries across disciplines -- also enjoy breaking all electronics in my house :O
