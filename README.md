## YO 🤖


Engineer. Builder. Professional tinkerer of both code and circuits.  

Moving into 30's yes i know! (still 29 though;))
Chaos is just a puzzle I happen to be really good at solving
Pattern recognition x 100 😉

I’m currently sharpening my teeth on C and C++, while cooking up advanced Python projects that actually do more than just sit there and look pretty.  

What I’m Building & Exploring.... 
Marketplaces & fintech for Sri Lanka  — designing scalable systems with real local impact.  
Startups & tech innovation — I don’t just study business models, I stress-test them. 


Beyond Computer Science 
Because staying in one lane is boring 😏
Mechanical engineering — figuring out how things move, break, and can be rebuilt smarter.  
Electrical engineering — learning circuits and control systems as a stepping stone toward robotics.  
I’m new to these areas, but I learn fast and enjoy breaking boundaries across disciplines -- also enjoy breaking all electronics in my house :O
